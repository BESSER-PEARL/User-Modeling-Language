| Dimension            | Explanation | Reference |
|---------------------|-------------|-----------|
| Anthropometric| Describes the user’s body measurements and proportions, such as height, weight, and limb dimensions, which may influence their accessibility needs (e.g., reachability, ergonomics). | [22] |
| Speech | Represents attributes relating to the user’s ability to produce and articulate speech. | [22]|
| Hearing | Represents attributes relating to the user's hearling levels at different frequencies  |[11] [22]|
| Cognitive | Encompasses cognitive abilities such as memory, attention, problem-solving, and information processing, which may affect how users interact with digital and physical environments. | [6] [22]|
| Sight | Refers to the user’s visual capabilities. | [6] [11] [12] [22]|
| Disability | Describes a concrete disability a user might have | [6] [7] [14] [21] [22] [23]|
| Memory | Represents the user’s ability to retain and recall information, including short-term and long-term memory functions. | [6] [20] [22] |
|PhysiologicalState | Describes temporary or chronic conditions affecting the user’s physical well-being, such as fatigue. | [20] |
|Motoric | Captures fine and gross motor skills, including dexterity, coordination, and muscle controls. |  [6] [11]|
| Mobility | Represents the user’s ability to move independently, including precise information on the different limbs of the user. | [11] [12] |
