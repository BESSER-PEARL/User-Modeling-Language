| Dimension            | Explanation | Reference |
|---------------------|-------------|-----------|
|  feminity_to_masculinity| Measures the extent to which a society values nurturing, cooperation, and quality of life (femininity) versus achievement, competition, and material success (masculinity). | [30] |
|  collectivism_to_individualism|  Reflects whether a culture prioritizes group cohesion and interdependence (collectivism) or personal independence and self-reliance (individualism). | [30] |
|  powerDistance|  Indicates the acceptance of hierarchical structures and unequal power distribution in society, from low (egalitarian) to high (authoritarian). | [30] |
|  uncertainityAvoidance|  Represents how much a culture tolerates ambiguity and uncertainty, ranging from low (embracing change) to high (preferring rules and stability). | [30] |
|  temporalOrientation| Describes whether a culture focuses on long-term planning, perseverance, and future rewards (long-term) or values traditions, quick results, and the present (short-term). | [30] |
|  restrain_to_indulgence| Captures the degree to which a society controls desires and impulses, with indulgence favoring enjoyment and leisure, while restraint emphasizes discipline and social norms. | [30] |
|  religion | A user's religious belief. | [31] |
