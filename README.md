# BESSER-User-Modeling-Language

The BESSER-User-Modeling language provides a unified user modeling language to model users in a comprehensive way, covering numerous user dimensions. 
The complete metamodel is available in multiple formats:
- Editable draw.io version: ![User Metamodel Draw.io](metamodel/usermetamodel.drawio.xml)
- PNG version of draw.io file: ![User Metamodel image](metamodel/usermetamodel.png)
- B-UML version: ![User Metamodel in BUML](metamodel/usermetamodel_buml.py)
- Image of condensed metamodel, providing an overview of the dimension categories: ![Condensed User Metamodel](metamodel/condensedusermetamodel.png)

The metamodel consists of the following dimension categories: 
- [Personal Information](metamodel/PersonalInformation/)
- [Accessibility](metamodel/Accessibility/)
- [Personality](metamodel/Personality/)
- [Competence](metamodel/Competence/)
- [Culture](metamodel/Culture/)
- [Goal](metamodel/Goal/)

## References
The modeling language was mainly created based on the results from a systematic literature review on user modeling in model-driven engineering: [User Modeling in Model-Driven Engineering: A Systematic Literature Review](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15871).

A concrete mapping of user dimension to reference is available in the individual folders of the dimension categories.
